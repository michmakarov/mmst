		There is not true supporting of different languages.<br>
		That is the button gives you another variant (if it is) wich may be not the same in details.<br>
		At 220102 such button is only here. It means that you can switch the variant only here and after it is necessary to reload interested page.<br>
		In fact only the "/aboutAuthor" (besides this page) has two variants.

<div id="maindiv">A purpose of this site is to serve as a resume; that is to give an info about the author to a potential employer.<br>
    In other words, the author posites himself as a IT expert and hopes that there is an employer which will hire him.<br>
    There is a wise man that said to me that this nonsense nobody will read. But what if?<br>
    <br>
    To contact the author you may send a letter. See form of <b>Letter</b> below.<br>
    Also there are telephone for SMS (only):+79534737768.<br>
    <br>
    Beneath you may see referenses (in boxes circled by dots) that details the info<br>
	Of cause, there are many other requests, that the backend recognized; but them are service and unlikely interesting<br>
	
	<div class="query">
		<a href="/aboutAuthor"> Query /aboutAuthor - about author's career and his skills</a>
	</div><br><!-- query /aboutAuthor -->
	
	<div class="query">
		If somebody will want to see how this site has been creating then please here.<br>
		<a href="/history"> Query /history - about the history of creating this site</a>
		This page in main part for the author himself - to see quickly what and when has he done.<br>
		But if you are curious - welcome.
	</div><br><!-- query /history" -->
	
	<div class="query">

<div id="formdiv">
	Above there are references that allows you only reading.<br>
	But below there are forms that give you some interaction.<br>
	Thus, by the form of <b>Letter</b> you may send a letter to author.<br>

	<div class="form">
		<b>Letter</b><br>
		Here you may sent a message to the author.<br>
		It will be saved as a distinct file and with sending a notifying SMS to the work phone of author, that is constantly with him.<br>
		If in the message will be a question (or a offer) with an email address the author will contact you.<br>
		If there will be only a phone number the auther will not contact you through it.<br>
		Due to the limited storage space for the massages there is probability of losing your message.<br>
		Besides this, if your message has more then 3000 bytes it will be truncated.<br>
