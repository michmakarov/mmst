	This is the page about the author, in English 
	<h3>Preface</h3>
	<p> This informs about author's career</p>
	<p>He (author) was burn at 1951 and takes the base (that is before 5-6 year old, further I was taught Russian language, in first turn) upbringing in peasant's russian village family.</p>
	<p> I suddenly reveal that I have not any file with image of myself <br>
		But I saw an very typical image of population of my village in the blog of some respectful man.<br>
		You may select any face from there and it will be my image. See ..<br>

	</p>
	<p>Next I briefly (as it are not memoirs) say about my career with touching of achievments on each stage.</p>
	<h3>The life stages</h3>
	<p> - 1972: school, plant (receiving the skill of a mechanic or locksmith)	</p>
	<p> 1972 - 1976: education in a high school (engineer-mechanic), it I did not end properly and so does not have a document about.<br>
		Why? I think, here is not pertinently to ponder about it.
	</p>
	<p> 1976 - 2000: locksmith, workshop foreman, constructor, technologist, head of the design unit.<br>
		This and next stages was overlapped. In area of overlapping was some IT achievements. For example:<br>
		Automation of work (AutoCad ...) of my technologists and constructors.<br>
		Or developing and exploitation floppy-net, that is synchronization workstations by floppy-disks
	</p>
	<p> 1995 - 2008: head of the IT department.<br>
		Here achievements are a bit more impressive.<br>
		This is the automation of accounting and warehouse activities of the enterprise (~3000 of staff at that time)<br>
		Or developing and debugging a soft for some equipment.<br>
		Or  CAD system  for technology department of the enterprise.<br>
		And others ...
	</p>
	<p> 2017 - 2021: software engineer.<br>
	Here is no impressive achievements. There is rather learning, that I hope, did a programer of me.
	</p>
	<p> 2021 - : free as a bird</p>
