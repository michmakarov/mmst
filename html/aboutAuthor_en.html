	This is the page about the author, in English 
	<h3>Preface</h3>
	<p> This informs about author's career</p>
	<p>He (author) was born at 1951 and takes the fundamental (that is that is before 5-6 year old, further I was taught Russian language, in first turn, and tought, tought ...) upbringing in a peasant's russian village family.</p>
	<p>In the family I adopted firmly that a pearl grain is worse than a rye one.</p>
	<p> I suddenly reveal that I have not any file with image of myself <br>
		But I saw an very typical image of population of my village in the blog of some respectful man.<br>
		You may select any face from there and it will be my image. See ..<br>

	</p>
	<p>Next I briefly (as it are not memoirs) say about my career with touching of achievments (in IT sphere) on each stage.</p>
	<h3>The life stages</h3>
	<p> - 1972: school, plant (receiving the skill of a mechanic or locksmith)	</p>
	<p> 1972 - 1976: education in a high school (engineer-mechanic), it I did not end properly and so does not have a document about.<br>
		Why? I think, here is not pertinently to ponder about it.
	</p>
	<p> 1976 - 2000: locksmith, workshop foreman, constructor, technologist, head of the design unit.<br>
		This and next stages was overlapped. In area of overlapping was some IT achievements. For example:<br>
		Automation of work (AutoCad ...) of my technologists and constructors.<br>
		Or developing and exploitation floppy-net, that is synchronization workstations by floppy-disks <br>
		Or a program (on Microsoft Excel) for accounting dirty refuses
	</p>
	<p> 1995 - 2008: head of the IT department.<br>
		Here achievements are a bit more impressive.<br>
		This is the automation of accounting and warehouse activities of the enterprise (~3000 of staff at that time)<br>
		Or developing and debugging a soft for some equipment.<br>
		Or  CAD system  for technology department of the enterprise.<br>
		And others ...
	</p>
	<p> 2017 - 2021: software engineer.<br>
	Here is no impressive achievements. There is rather learning, that I hope, did a programer of me.
	</p>
	<p> 2021 - : free as a bird</p>
	<h3>Skills</h3>
	<p> I do not think that my mechanic skills are actual and may give me some incoming.<br>
		But I hope that my IT skills are fresher so I will be saying only about them.
	</p>
	<p>Basic, Pascal, dbase, Delphi under ОСРВ СМ ЭВМ, DOS, WINDOWS; Microsoft Excel, Access: with them I begun in the end of 20 century.</p>
	<p>Windows API, Pascal, Delphi, Interbase, SQL, C as necessary instruments for ruling of development of software for Windows NT. It was in begin of 21 century.</p>
	<p>C, Golang. Bash, HTML, JS, Postgresql, Firebird, Mysql, Apache, SQL, Git, Docker under Linux (Ubuntu). Those are the most actual ones.</p>
	<p>Above I do not list Java, C#, Perl, Python ... as I know them on educational level.</p>
	<h3>Languages</h3>
	<p>I can speek only Russian, but prefer English documentations.<br>
	How can I write English I do not know for nobody have evaluated it. 
	</p>
	<h3>Connection</h3>
	<p>About it is on the main page (/).</p>
	<h3>cannots and dreams</h3>
	<p>
		I cannot read Chines but very want.<br>
		I have not enough knowledge (for me) about:<br>
		networking;<br>
		operating systems, especially booting and drivers;<br>
		I did not do applications for mobile devices.<br>
	</p>
	<h3>Prejudices</h3>
	<p>
		I see the CLI as the best user interface.<br>
		I do not see any profit of the JQUERY (as there is JS and DOM).<br>
		I find that it is more easy to write own code than to use another's one.<br>
		I think that rabble codes (<i>быдлокод</i> in Russian) is that that have not been written by you.<br>
		I think that banks are essential part of this world as any parasites.<br>
		The fair work does not result in a palace<br>
		Secrecy is vitally needed only for thieves and robbers<br>
